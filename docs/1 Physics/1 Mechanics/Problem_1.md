# Problem 1


# Newton's Laws of Motion

## 1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**

An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

### Mathematically:
\[
F_{\text{net}} = 0 \Rightarrow \text{constant velocity (zero acceleration)}
\]

**Example:** A ball on a flat surface will remain stationary unless a force is applied to it (like a push).

## 2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass.

### Mathematically:
\[
F = m \cdot a
\]
